                    •	Authentication: Your school email and choice of password are utilized for account creation and authentication. (There is no link between PolyPal’s account creation to school email. School email is used to send verification email to confirm user is student).
                    
                    •	Profile Information: We use your profile details to personalize your experience on PolyPals and connect you with other users.

                    3. Data Storage:

                    4. Third-Party Services:
                    •	PolyPals utilizes third-party services for authentication, data storage, hosting, and push notifications. These services are subject to their respective privacy policies.

                    •	Current Location Feature: PolyPals tracks real-time locations; however, it relies on user-pinned coordinates meaning locations aren’t seen by other’s unless pinned by user.
